## 1. Executive Summary
This report documents the review of a simulated security alert as part of the TryHackMe **SOC Fundamentals** room.

The objective of this exercise was to understand how Security Operations Center (SOC) teams monitor, triage, and escalate alerts in a real-world operational environment.

---

## 2. Alert Description
A simulated alert was generated to represent suspicious activity detected by a security monitoring system.

The alert required evaluation to determine whether it represented a true security incident or a false positive.

---

## 3. SOC Triage Workflow
The alert was reviewed following standard SOC procedures:

- Alert severity and context were assessed  
- Relevant log sources were identified conceptually  
- Potential impact was evaluated  
- An escalation decision was considered  

---

## 4. Findings
Based on the information provided in the simulation, there were no confirmed indicators of malicious activity.

The alert did not meet the criteria for escalation and was classified as a low-severity event.

---

## 5. Escalation Decision
The alert was handled at the Tier 1 SOC level and did not require escalation to Tier 2 analysts.

The event was documented and closed following standard SOC procedures.

---

## 6. Lessons Learned & Best Practices
- Effective alert triage is critical to SOC efficiency  
- Not all alerts indicate real attacks  
- Clear escalation criteria reduce alert fatigue  
- Documentation is essential for incident tracking  

---

## 7. Conclusion
This exercise demonstrates the core responsibilities of SOC analysts, including alert monitoring, triage, decision-making, and documentation within a Security Operations Center.
