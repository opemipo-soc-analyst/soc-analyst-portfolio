## 1. Executive Summary
This report documents the review of a simulated security alert as part of the TryHackMe **Intro to Defensive Security** room.

The objective of this exercise was to understand the role of defensive security teams and the basic workflow used by SOC analysts to identify, triage, and classify alerts, rather than to investigate a real-world security breach.

---

## 2. Alert Description
A simulated alert was generated to represent suspicious activity detected by a security monitoring system.

The alert required evaluation to determine whether it indicated a genuine security incident or a false positive.

---

## 3. SOC Analysis Approach
The alert was reviewed using a standard SOC triage process:

- The alert context and description were examined
- Potential causes of the alert were considered
- The possible impact to systems and users was evaluated
- Alert severity was assessed based on available information

This process focused on alert classification and decision-making rather than technical forensic analysis.

---

## 4. Findings
Based on the information provided in the simulation, there were no confirmed indicators of malicious activity.

The alert lacked sufficient evidence to classify it as a real security incident and was therefore assessed as low severity.

---

## 5. SOC Analyst Decision
The alert was classified as a **False Positive** and did not require escalation to higher-tier SOC analysts.

No remediation actions were necessary beyond proper documentation and continued monitoring.

---

## 6. Lessons Learned & Recommendations
- Not all alerts represent real attacks
- Proper alert triage reduces unnecessary workload for SOC teams
- Clear documentation is essential for effective SOC operations
- Understanding alert context is critical before escalation

---

## 7. Conclusion
This exercise demonstrates the foundational workflow used by SOC analysts when handling alerts, from initial review through classification and closure.

The room provided essential insight into defensive security concepts and SOC operational responsibilities.
